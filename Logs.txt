=> Making Raindrop scale to 0.01f for now.
=> Making Raindrop spawner
	(-) Keeping all children to 1 parent for now.
		[=] Can only add/remove child.
	(-) Keeping a pool of children
	(-) IT WORKS!!
	(-) queue_free just frees the node.
	(-) remove_child just removes from the scene tree, but keeps the node around.
		[=] If there is a reference, then can use the reference to make the object active again.

=> Making RainDrop Spawner
	(-) Random x-position works for now.
	(-) Making counter to check if all the drops have been spawned or not.
	(-) [Fix] Make timePassed be dependent on delta.
		[=] Currently, it will have variable timing according to the device specs/frame rate on the device.
=> DropsController
	(-) Give each drop a unique id.
=> DropsSpawner
	(-) Receive drops id and disable them.
	(-) When spawning drops,
		[=] [Do] After spawning all drops, we would have to look through the array to check which drop is available now for respawn.
	(-) Assigning each drop an id at the time of spawning.
	(-) [BUG] Removing drops at collision gives invalid child count.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Need to make a better pool manager to manage drops.
=> For disabling a node
	(-) Reparenting and then removing, by calling the parent node's remove child at index 0, might work?
	(-) Should make the process much easier.
	(-) [Done] Just passing a pointer of drop detected by player to the Spawner to disable it for now.
		[=] Was calling "queue_free" at the test, so next time the node was being added, it wwas giving error, or crashing.
=> [Do] Have DropsSpawner to check whether all the spawned drops are above the ground or not.
	(-) Function checking every 1 sec or so for this.
=> [Do] Make mechanism to check if the drop is below ground.
=> [Do] Make the drop pass through the ground without interacting, collision off.

=> [DOne] Setting rigidbody of the raindrops to freeze, when disabling
	(-) Also setting the linear velocity to 0.
=> [Do] Make playable test level with given test track.
=> [Do] Make Touch controls
	(-) Keyboard/Arrow controls are not that good. 
		[=] Moving left and right takes time.
	(-) Moving cursor too quickly effectively breaks code.
