=> Making Raindrop scale to 0.01f for now.
=> Making Raindrop spawner
	(-) Keeping all children to 1 parent for now.
		[=] Can only add/remove child.
	(-) Keeping a pool of children
	(-) IT WORKS!!
	(-) queue_free just frees the node.
	(-) remove_child just removes from the scene tree, but keeps the node around.
		[=] If there is a reference, then can use the reference to make the object active again.

=> [Do] Need to make a better pool manager to manage drops.
=> For disabling a node
	(-) Reparenting and then removing, by calling the parent node's remove child at index 0, might work?
	(-) Should make the process much easier.

		[=] Was calling "queue_free" at the test, so next time the node was being added, it wwas giving error, or crashing.
=> [Do] Have DropsSpawner to check whether all the spawned drops are above the ground or not.
	(-) Function checking every 1 sec or so for this.
=> [Do] Make mechanism to check if the drop is below ground.
=> [Do] Make the drop pass through the ground without interacting, collision off.
